# About

I'm interested in the application of machine learning in affect detection through physiological sensing. I aspire to better understand our decisions and behaviors in social contexts involving interpersonal interactions. Broadly, I'm interested in topics including privacy, trust, and deception.

My research so far has been in the domain of human-computer interaction. As a member of [Interactive Computing Lab][5] headed by [Prof. Uichin Lee][4], I'm currently working on the SuggestBot project that aims to develop a context-aware smart interaction service platform, with [Auk Kim][1], [Suwon Kang][2], and [Narae Cha][3].
