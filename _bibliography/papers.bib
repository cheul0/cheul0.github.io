  abstract = {We envision a wide range of novel proactive conversational services for smart speakers such as context-aware reminders and restocking household items. When initiating conversational interactions proactively, smart speakers need to consider users' contexts to minimize disruption. In this work, we aim to broaden our understanding of opportune moments for proactive conversational interactions in domestic contexts. Toward this goal, we build a voice-based experience sampling device and conduct a one-week field study with 40 participants living in university dormitories. We collect 3,572 in-situ user experience reports and propose 19 activity categories to study contextual factors related to interruptibility. Our data analysis results show that the key determinants for opportune moments are closely related to both personal contextual factors such as busyness, mood, and resource conflicts for dual-tasking, and the other contextual factors associated with the everyday routines at home, including user mobility and social presence. Based on this finding, we discuss the need for designing context-aware proactive conversation management features that dynamically control conversational interactions based on users' contexts and routines.},

  title = {Share and Share Alike? An Exploration of Secure Behaviors in Romantic Relationships},
  abstract = {Security design choices often fail to take into account users' social context. Our work is among the first to examine security behavior in romantic relationships. We surveyed 195 people on Amazon Mechanical Turk about their relationship status and account sharing behavior for a cross-section of popular websites and apps (e.g., Netflix, Amazon Prime). We examine differences in account sharing behavior at different stages in a relationship and for people in different age groups and income levels. We also present a taxonomy of sharing motivations and behaviors based on the iterative coding of open-ended responses. Based on this taxonomy, we present design recommendations to support end users in three relationship stages: when they start sharing access with romantic partners; when they are maintaining that sharing; and when they decide to stop. Our findings contribute to the field of usable privacy and security by enhancing our understanding of security and privacy behaviors and needs in intimate social relationships.},
