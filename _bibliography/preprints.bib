  title = {K-EmoCon, a multimodal sensor dataset for continuous emotion recognition in naturalistic conversations},
  abstract = {A multimodal dataset, namely K-EmoCon, of continuous emotions collected in naturalistic conversations is presented here. K-EmonCon consists of data from 32 participants debating on a social issue for approximately 10 minutes in pairs. The data sources include brainwaves (electroencephalogram), skin conductance (electrodermal activity), body temperature, heart rate (photoplethysmogram and electrocardiogram), blood volume pulse (PPG), and tri-axial acceleration. Videos from the frontal face view and first-person camera view are also included, so to capture facial expressions and gestures above the waist. Participants rated their own emotions (1st-person perspective label) and their partnersâ€™ emotions (2nd-person perspective label) watching the video recording of their corresponding debate. Collected emotions include arousal-valence, five emotions related to the subjective stress level, and 13 educationally relevant emotions. Statistical analysis results in aggregated distributions of labels and comparative plots of individual variance in emotions. Overall, the proposed K-EmoCon allows, for the first time, the investigation of mismatch in emotion perception during social interactions, with potential use in facilitating emotional communication and development of assistive tools for social-emotional skills.},

  title = {"Hello There! Is Now a Good Time to Talk?": Opportune Moments for Proactive Interactions with Smart Speakers},
  abstract = {We envision a wide range of novel proactive conversational services for smart speakers such as context-aware reminders and restocking household items. When initiating conversational interactions proactively, smart speakers need to consider users' contexts to minimize disruption. In this work, we aim to broaden our understanding of opportune moments for proactive conversational interactions in domestic contexts. Toward this goal, we build a voice-based experience sampling device and conduct a one-week field study with 40 participants living in university dormitories. We collect 3,572 in-situ user experience reports and propose 19 activity categories to study contextual factors related to interruptibility. Our data analysis results show that the key determinants for opportune moments are closely related to both personal contextual factors such as busyness, mood, and resource conflicts for dual-tasking, and the other contextual factors associated with the everyday routines at home, including user mobility and social presence. Based on this finding, we discuss the need for designing context-aware proactive conversation management features that dynamically control conversational interactions based on users' contexts and routines.},
