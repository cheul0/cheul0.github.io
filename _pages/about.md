My research interests include Affective Computing & Human-Computer Interaction. I am also interested in applying Machine Learning to understand the relationship between our affective states and physiological signals and exploring how we can use that knowledge for real-world applications such as digital healthcare.

I am currently a Master's student in the [Graduate School of Knowledge Service Engineering](https://kse.kaist.ac.kr/) at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/). I recently defended my thesis and will be graduating this February.

I am a member of the [Interactive Computing Lab](http://ic.kaist.ac.kr/wiki/wiki.cgi?Main) at KAIST. During my time here, I worked on the following projects:
* [AdaptiveESM](https://github.com/cheulyop/AdaptiveESM) - an adaptive sampling method based on active learning for emotions in the wild.
* [PyTEAP](https://github.com/cheulyop/PyTEAP) - a Python implementation of the Toolbox for Emotion Analysis using Physiological signals ([TEAP](https://github.com/Gijom/TEAP)).
* [K-EmoCon dataset](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3762961) for the [SuggestBot Project](https://suggestbot.github.io/) - a multimodal sensor dataset for continuous emotion recognition in naturalistic conversations.
